# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into a collection of simple subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

__Dynamic Programming -> Dynamic Optimization.__

__Dynamic Programming -> Recursion + Memoization.__


#### 7 Steps to solve a Dynamic Programming problem :

  1 - Recognize a DP problem.

  2 - Identify problem variables.

  3 - Clearly express the recurrence relation.

  4 - Identify the base cases.

  5 - Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively.

  6 - Add memoization.

  7 - Determine time complexity.
