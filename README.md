# Dynamic Programming


`Dynamic programming` is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into a collection of simple `subproblems`, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. This saves computation time.


### The Magic Formula

` DP Time Complexity = Number of Function Calls x Work Done per Function Call`
